## Installation

Installation of the Winter-Summer-School-iOS App should be as simple as cloning the existing repository, opening the project with Xcode Version 8.2.1 or later, and building the project for your target device. There is however, a caveat involved with compiling this App for iOS 10.2 and 10.3 with Xcode 8.2.1. This version of Xcode doesn't supply developer device images for 10.2 and 10.3 by default, and so you'll likely have to download them and install them in `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport`. Finally, Xcode signs products prior to deploying them on devices, so there *may* be some issues with signing too. Please begin an issue if you encounter any.

## Usage

This application mostly sticks to well known Apple standards for UI design, and so usage should be completely intuitive to anyone familiar with devices running iOS.
